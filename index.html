            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm Ada, a Data Scientist with a passion for uncovering insights from data and making data-driven decisions. Currently, I'm a Data Scientist at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, where I do research on large language models. I'm also a calligrapher and classical violinist. Welcome to my personal website!</p>

            <h2>Why I Chose Data Science</h2>
            <h4>Inspiration from John Tukey 😃</h4>
            <p>John Tukey once said, “The best thing about being a statistician is that you get to play in everyone's backyard.” This sentiment resonated deeply with me and was a major reason why I pursued statistics, which naturally led me to data science. It’s applicable to nearly any field!</p>

            <h4>A Perfect Blend of Programming and Statistics 💻</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>In high school, A.P. Statistics was my favorite class.</li>
                <li>In college, I enjoyed my coding classes and the logical problem-solving they required.</li>
                <li>Data science is the perfect combination of these two subjects, bringing the best of both worlds together!</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Data Science Aligns with my Personality 💁🏻‍♀️</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Love for Organization</strong> — Data scientists need to organize their data first to make sense of it! My friends tell me "you're the most organized person I know."</li>
                <li><strong>Data-Driven Decision-Making</strong> — Every decision I make is rooted in logic and evidence, which is the heart of data science!</li>
                <li><strong>Attention to Detail</strong> — Just like a data scientist should validate their results, I naturally double-check everything, ensuring accuracy and reliability in my work.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Fun Facts About "Ada"</h2>
            <h4>It’s a Technical Name 👩🏻‍💻</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Ada is a technical name! This is a coincidence. When my parents named me, they had no idea I would go into artificial intelligence!</li>
                <li>Ada Lovelace was the world’s first computer scientist.</li>
                <li>There’s even a programming language named Ada.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>It Rhymes with “Data” 😆</h4>
            <p>It’s pronounced “dayduh”, not “dadduh”. :)</p>
            <h4>It’s Pronounced like Eta η</h4>
            <p>Ada is pronounced like the Greek letter eta η, which is the learning rate in the gradient descent algorithm. I love this connection, because I LOVE to learn (as a child, I’d count down the days until school started)!</p>
            <p>There is another, more advanced version of the vanilla gradient descent algorithm, called Adaptive Gradient, or AdaGrad. Instead of a fixed learning rate, the learning rate adjusts, much like people do in real life. I love how machine learning algorithms reflect human learning.</p>
