                <h2><u>About Me</u></h2>
                <p>I'm Ada, a Data Scientist with a passion for uncovering insights from data and making data-driven decisions. Currently, I'm a Data Scientist at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, where I do research on large language models. I'm also a calligrapher and classical violinist. Welcome to my personal website!</p>

                <h2><u>Why I Chose Data Science</u></h2>

                <h4>Inspiration from John Tukey</h4>
                <p>John Tukey once said, ‚ÄúThe best thing about being a statistician is that you get to play in everyone's backyard.‚Äù This sentiment resonated deeply with me and was a major reason why I pursued statistics, which naturally led me to data science. It‚Äôs applicable to nearly any field!</p>

                <h4>A Perfect Blend of Programming and Statistics</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>In high school, A.P. Statistics was my favorite class.</li>
                    <li>In college, I enjoyed my coding classes and the logical problem-solving they required.</li>
                    <li>Data science is the perfect combination of these two subjects, bringing the best of both worlds together!</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Data Science Aligns with my Personality</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Love for Organization</strong></li>
                        <p>Data scientists need to organize their data first to make sense of it! My friends tell me "you're the most organized person I know."</p>
                    <li><strong>Data-Driven Decision-Making</strong></li>
                        <p>Every decision I make is rooted in logic and evidence, which is the heart of data science!</p>
                    <li><strong>Attention to Detail</strong></li>
                        <p>Just like a data scientist should validate their results, I naturally double-check everything, ensuring accuracy and reliability in my work.</p>
                </ul>

                <h2><u>Fun Facts About "Ada"</u></h2>

                <h4>It‚Äôs a Technical Name</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ada is a technical name! (This is a coincidence ‚Äì When my parents named me, they had no idea I would go into artificial intelligence.)</li>
                        <li>Ada Lovelace was the world‚Äôs first computer scientist.</li>
                        <li>There‚Äôs even a programming language named Ada!</li>
                    </ul>
                <h4>It Rhymes with ‚ÄúData‚Äù</h4>
                    <p>It‚Äôs pronounced ‚Äúdayduh‚Äù, not ‚Äúdadduh‚Äù. üòÜ</p>
                <h4>It‚Äôs Pronounced like Eta Œ∑</h4>
                    <p>Ada is pronounced like the Greek letter eta Œ∑, which is the learning rate in the gradient descent algorithm. I love this connection, because I LOVE to learn (as a child, I‚Äôd count down the days until school started)!</p>
                    <p>There is another, more advanced version of the vanilla gradient descent algorithm, called AdaGrad. Instead of a fixed learning rate, the learning rate adjusts, much like people do in real life. I find it inspiring to see machine learning algorithms reflect human learning.</p>
