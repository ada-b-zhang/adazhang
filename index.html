            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm Ada, a Data Scientist with a passion for uncovering insights from data and making data-driven decisions. Currently, I do research on large language models at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. I'm also a calligrapher and classical violinist. Welcome to my personal website!</p>

            <h2>Why I Chose Data Science</h2>
            <h4>Inspiration from John Tukey 😃</h4>
            <p>John Tukey once said, “The best thing about being a statistician is that you get to play in everyone's backyard.” This quote resonated deeply with me and was a major reason why I pursued statistics, which naturally led me to data science. It’s applicable to pretty much any field!</p>

            <h4>A Perfect Blend of Programming and Statistics 💻</h4>
            <p>In high school, A.P. Statistics was my favorite class. I enjoyed my coding classes in college and the logical problem-solving they required. Data science is the perfect combination of these two subjects, bringing the best of both worlds together!</p>

            <h4>Data Science Aligns with my Personality 💁🏻‍♀️</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>I like organization, and data scientists need to organize their data in order to make sense of it! My friends tell me "you're the most organized person I know."</li>
                <li>I like to make decisions based on data, which is the heart of data science!</li>
                <li>I like details. Just like a data scientist should validate their results, I naturally double-check everything, ensuring accuracy and reliability in my work.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>It’s All in the Name</h2>

            <h4>A Technical Name 👩🏻‍💻</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Ada is a technical name! My name coincidentally has many connections to artificial intelligence. When my parents named me, they had no idea I would go into AI!</li>
                <li>Ada Lovelace was the world’s first computer scientist.</li>
                <li>There’s even a programming language called Ada.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Rhymes with “Data” 📊</h4>
            <p>It’s pronounced “dayduh”, not “dadduh” 😆.</p>
            
            <h4>OpenAI's Embedding Model 🤓</h4>
            <p>OpenAI has an embedding model called `text-embedding-ada-002`.</p>
            
            <h4>Sounds like Eta (η)</h4>
            <p>Ada sounds like the Greek letter eta, η, which is the learning rate in the gradient descent algorithm. I LOVE to learn (as a child, I’d count down the days until school started)!</p>
            <p>There is another, more advanced version of the vanilla gradient descent algorithm, called Adaptive Gradient, or AdaGrad. Instead of a fixed learning rate, the learning rate adjusts, much like people do in real life. I love how machine learning algorithms reflect human learning!</p>
            <p>There's also AdaFactor, AdaDelta, AdaBoost, AdaNet, etc.</p>
